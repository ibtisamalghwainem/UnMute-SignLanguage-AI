##  Project Vision

In a world full of sound, some live in silence‚Äîunseen and unheard.  
Un-Mute is a human-centered AI initiative that aims to:

- Shift societal perceptions of the deaf community  
- Highlight their talents and capabilities  
- Promote awareness and inclusion  
- Deliver interactive visual content that reflects their language and culture

---

##  Technical Overview

A deep learning model built with MobileNetV2 to classify Arabic sign language images into 36 distinct categories.

### Pipeline:
1. **Data Cleaning & Structuring**  
   - Remove duplicates  
   - Normalize folder names  
   - Balance image distribution

2. **Augmentation & Preprocessing**  
   - Smart image transformations  
   - Gaussian blur, rotation, brightness tuning  
   - Arabic reshaping and bidirectional text handling

3. **Exploratory Analysis**  
   - Visual distribution of images per class  
   - Insights before and after balancing

4. **Model Training**  
   - MobileNetV2 base with frozen layers  
   - Dense layers + Dropout  
   - EarlyStopping for optimal performance

5. **Evaluation & Visualization**  
   - Accuracy tracking across epochs  
   - Prediction vs. ground truth samples

6. **Text-to-Speech Integration**  
   - Converts Arabic predictions into spoken output using `gTTS` and `edge-tts`
